## Contents in Repo
CodeBook.md describing the variables, the data and any transformation or work that was done to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the R script that was used to create the tidy data set.  The steps done were:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each  
   subject.

tidydataset.txt is the output of the tidy data set.
